**In this project, I will try to build a copy of an existing webpage (google.com) using HTML, CSS, and developer tools**

The goals for this project are:

- See how elements get placed on the page
- See how elements are styled and aligned
- Build something in HTML
- Get more comfortable with git and version control

Skills demonstrated:

- Displayed elements (text, images, etc) on the page using HTML
- Aligned elements to different parts of the page
- Created a navigation bar using unordered list formatting
- Created a page footer using unordered list formatting
- Styled links (visited, hover, active)
- Used developer tools to find what font/colors are used for text

*will continue to update throughout project*
